1.What is java ?
➢ Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few 
implementation dependencies as possible.
➢ It is a general-purpose programming language intended to let programmers write once, run anywhere, 
meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need to recompile.
➢ it is used to develop a wide variety of applications, including:
➢ Web applications, Mobile applications, Desktop applications, Enterprise software, Scientific applications, and 
Embedded systems.
2.Explain the differ b/w JDK, JRE, JVM.
JDK :
Java Development Kit is a software development environment that includes JRE and development tools. It's 
used to create Java applications and applets. JDK includes tools like a compiler, debugger, and documentation 
generator.
JRE :
Java Runtime Environment is a set of software tools that provides a runtime environment for running other 
software. It's used to run Java applications. JRE contains class libraries, supporting files, and the JVM.
JVM :
Java Virtual Machine is the foundation of Java programming language and ensures the program's Java source 
code will be platform-agnostic. It's used to run Java bytecode. JVM is included in both JDK and JRE, and Java programs 
won't run without it.
3. what are the main features of java ?
1. Simple and Easy to Learn. Java is easy to learn and simple to use as a programming language. 
2. Object-Oriented Programming. 
3. Platform Independence. 
4. Automatic Memory Management. 
5. Security. 
6. Rich API. 
7. Multithreading. 
8. High Performance
9. Scalability
4. what is differ b/w java and javascript ?
➢ Java is an OOP programming language while Java Script is an OOP scripting language.
➢ Java creates applications that run in a virtual machine or browser while JavaScript code is run on a browser 
only. 
➢ Java code needs to be compiled while JavaScript code are all in text.
5. what is an object-oriented programming language?
Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming language that uses objects to bind data and the functions that 
operate on it. The goal of OOP is to implement real-world entities like inheritance, hiding, and polymorphism. OOP 
concepts include:
❖ Class 
❖ Object
❖ Inheritance 
❖ polymorphism
❖ encapsulation
❖ abstraction

36. What are the different types of variables in java ?
There are three different types of variables in Java:
Local variables
the method, constructor, or block is entered and destroyed when it exits.Declare inside a method, 
constructor, or block. They are only accessible within the scope in which they are declared. Local variables are 
created when 
Instance variables
declared outside of any method, constructor, or block, but within a class. They are accessible to all 
methods within the class. Instance variables are created when an object is created and destroyed when the object is 
destroyed.
Static variables
declared with the static keyword. They are shared among all instances of a class. Static variables are created 
when the class is loaded and destroyed when the class is unloaded.
Here is an example of each type of variable:
public class MyClass {
 // Local variable
 private int myLocalVariable;
 // Instance variable
 private int myInstanceVariable;
 // Static variable
 private static int myStaticVariable;
 public void myMethod() {
 // Local variable
 int myLocalVariable = 10;
 // Access instance variable
 myInstanceVariable = 20;
/ Access static variable
 myStaticVariable = 30;
 }
}
37. How do you declare and initialize variable in java ?
// Declare an integer variable
int myNum = 5;
// Declare a float variable
float myFloatNum = 5.99f;
// Declare a character variable
char myLetter = 'D';
// Declare a boolean variable
boolean myBool = true;
// Declare a String variable
String myText = "Hello";
